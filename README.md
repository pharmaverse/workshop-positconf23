## Leveraging and contributing to the the pharmaverse for clinical trial reporting in R

*Date: All day, 17th of September*

### Abstract:

In this workshop we will introduce the pharmaverse, a collection of open source R packages that provide 
the next generation backbone for clinical trial reporting. As of March 2023, 123 people from more than 
10 companies have contributed to the pharmaverse packages - and this workshop is about how you can both 
leverage their work to date and get involved to help evolve this important collection of efforts.

We will create ADaM datasets, prepare ARDs, create tables and figures as well as interactive shiny apps. This course 
will also give a grounding in how to navigate pharmaverse R packages, and their repositories, and 
understand how you can contribute.

You should take this workshop if you are interested in the future of clinical trial reporting, and 
would like to join this shift to between company collaboration.
